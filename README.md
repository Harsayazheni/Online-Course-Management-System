## Design Explanation
1. Abstraction:
 Each class represents a real-world entity â€“ User, Student, Instructor, Course, and Assignment. Only relevant data and methods are exposed.
2. Encapsulation:
 Assignment grading is encapsulated using setGrade() and getGrade(). While most fields are public in the code, they can be made private and accessed via getters/setters for full encapsulation.
3. Inheritance:
 Student and Instructor inherit from the User class and reuse common attributes (name, email) and methods (getDetails()).
4. Polymorphism:
 getDetails() method is overridden in both Student and Instructor classes to show different outputs based on the object type.
## SOLID Principles 
S (Single Responsibility): Each class has a single responsibility (e.g., Course manages assignments and students).

O (Open/Closed): Classes are open for extension but closed for modification (e.g., more roles can be added without altering existing ones).

L (Liskov Substitution): Subclasses can replace the base class (User) without affecting correctness.

I (Interface Segregation): Not implemented yet, but interfaces like Gradable or Enrollable could be introduced.

D (Dependency Inversion): Not directly used, but can be applied with service layers or repositories.
